Next, Tim Berners-Lee’s work at CERN, where he developed the hypermedia system known as World Wide Web, added another layer of abstraction to the existing structure.
This abstraction provided an "addressing" scheme, a unique identifier (the Universal
Resource Locator), which could tell anyone "where to go and how to get there" for any
piece of data within the Web. While useful, it lacked dimensionality; there’s no
there within the web, and the only type of navigation permissible (other than surfing) is
by direct reference. In other words, I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forum
home page by saying, "http://www.wired.com/", which is not human-centered data.
